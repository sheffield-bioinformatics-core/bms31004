# Aims

This module is aimed at biology students with little or no knowledge of programming and statistics, with the aims of


1. having a good understanding of technologies and methods for Bioinformatics and are introduced to basic coding and the use of workflow and pipelines for their data analysis.
2. communicating their findings in a reproducible way; so that their peers can reach the same conclusions given the same starting data and well-annotated code

It will use a multidisciplinary approach integrated with programming tools to introduce students statistical concepts underpinning advanced data analysis and methods that are
suitable for high-throughput data analysis. Theoretical concepts and detailed examples will be introduced to provide the students with key steps to perform experimental design in data collection, data analysis and results validation.

The course will present state-of-the art research in computational biology and enable students to critically assess statistical methods and enhance innovative thinking in data
analysis. The students will be introduced to statistical concepts underpinning advanced data
analysis and methods that are suitable for high-throughput data analysis.
